# DbWrap++ for Firebird - yet another C++ database wrapper

## Overview

DbWrap++ for Firebird (DbWrap++FB) is a class library wrapper over
the _InterBase Applications Programming Interface (API)_, that is
used to access Firebird databases in a program.

Its purpose is to make relational database programming for
Firebird as easy as possible, without sacrificing efficiency.


## Requirements

DbWrap++FB makes use of C++ features available only in the C++11
standard of the C++ programming language, thus a C++11 capable
compiler is required.


## Tasks

Contributors are welcome to contact me.

Documentation is not yet available, but you can check the
"FbDbUnitTest.cpp" source file for sample usage.

The library was tested only in a Linux environment with the
embedded version of the Firebird 2.5 database.
